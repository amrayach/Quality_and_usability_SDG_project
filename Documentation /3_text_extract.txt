The given code performs the following tasks:

1. It imports necessary libraries including `fitz` for PDF processing, `os` for file operations, `pandas` for data manipulation, `spacy` for natural language processing, and `re` for regular expressions.

2. The code loads Spacy's large English NLP model "en_core_web_lg" and disables pipeline components that are not needed for sentence segmentation to improve processing speed.

3. It defines the input and output paths for the PDF files to be processed and the text files to be generated.

4. It checks if the output folder for text files exists and creates it if not.

5. It iterates through the PDF files in the input folder. For each PDF file:
   - It opens the PDF file with `fitz` and extracts the text per page.
   - It performs processing steps such as splitting the text after line breaks, stripping whitespace, and removing sentences shorter than two tokens.
   - It converts the processed list of sentences to a pandas DataFrame, removes empty rows and duplicate sentences.
   - It converts the list of sentences to a long text string and applies Spacy's NLP pipeline to extract sentences using the sentence recognizer model.
   - It applies additional processing steps to filter out short sentences.
   - It saves the extracted sentences as a text file with the same filename but different extension in the output folder.

In summary, the code reads PDF files from the input folder, processes them to extract sentences, and saves the extracted sentences as text files in the output folder. It utilizes libraries like `fitz` for PDF processing and `spacy` for NLP tasks.
