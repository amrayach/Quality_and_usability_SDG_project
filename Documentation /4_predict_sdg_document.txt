The provided code performs the following tasks:

1) Calculate keyword occurrences:
- It loads keywords from an Excel file ("UoA-SDG-Keyword-List-Ver.-1.1.xlsx") obtained from the University of Auckland.
- It creates a list of keywords for SDG 17 since the Excel file doesn't contain them.
- It initializes a keywords map to store keywords for each SDG.
- It iterates through the rows of the Excel file and adds keywords to the keywords map.
- It calculates weights for each SDG based on the distribution of keywords.
- It iterates through text files in the "Sustainability_Reports_TXT" folder.
- It reads each text file and counts the occurrences of keywords for each SDG.
- It multiplies the occurrences of each keyword by its corresponding weight.
- It saves the results in a pickle file named "keyword_result_per_sus_report.pickle".

2) Calculate sentence classifications:
- It checks if the model file ("final-model.pt") is already downloaded. If not, it downloads it from the Hugging Face model hub.
- It loads the Flair TextClassifier model from the downloaded file.
- It defines the input directory containing the extracted text files of the sustainability reports ("Sustainability_Reports_TXT").
- It defines the output directory for storing the sentence classifications for each sustainability report ("Sustainability_model_predictions").
- It iterates through the text files in the input directory.
- It reads each text file and splits it into sentences.
- It iterates through the sentences and classifies them using the loaded model.
- It creates a list of sentence predictions, where each prediction consists of the sentence text and the predicted SDG label.
- It saves the sentence predictions as CSV files in the output directory, with each text file having a corresponding CSV file.

In summary, the code calculates keyword occurrences for each SDG in the sustainability reports and saves the results in a pickle file. It also performs sentence-level classification using the Flair model and saves the predictions as CSV files.
