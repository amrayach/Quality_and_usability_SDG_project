THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT CHAIRMAN & CEO MESSAGE purpose is to refresh the world and We have remained true to that purpose for 137 years, and I am as encouraged today about the future of our business as I have ever been.
Our strategy is clear.
It’s centered around people— our consumers and employees—and driving sustainable solutions that build resilience into our business to respond to current and future challenges, while creating positive change for the planet.
GREAT BRANDS, BOLD EXPERIMENTATION As a total beverage company, we are committed to offering people more of the drinks they want across a range of categories and in a variety of sizes.
In 2022, we launched 246 low- or no-sugar beverages and continued to see double- digit growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, which is now available in more than 170 markets.
This helped to drive our volume of low- and no-calorie beverage sales to 29% of total volume.
We’re driving the most significant marketing transformation in our history, focused on digital-first engagement with consumers.
We’re combining partnerships, technology and our consumers’ passions to create unforgettable experiences in music, gaming and sports, including: • �Coca-Cola�Creations: This global innovation platform lends the iconic Coca-Cola brand to new expressions, driven by collaboration, creativity and cultural connection.
Launched in 2022, we introduced five limited-edition drinks that drew inspiration from music, gaming and culture.
These were complemented with experimental packaging designs and • Sprite�Limelight: A music and cultural extension of the brand’s global platform “Heat Happens,” Sprite Limelight aims to unite fans from different cultures and lifestyles by bringing together different artists from around the world.
We’re also experimenting with new drinks.
We’ve launched Jack Daniel’s & Coca-Cola as a ready-to-drink cocktail through a relationship with Brown-Forman.
This is one example of our ongoing journey to bring Coke to consumers in new and dynamic ways.
We take the new responsibilities that come with our entry in this space very seriously.
As a result, we’ve embedded our Global Policy on Alcohol Responsibility into our business processes to ensure we grow our alcohol brands in a responsible and sustainable way.
SUSTAINABILITY IS CORE TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY Water:
Water is a priority for our company because it is the first ingredient in all our beverages and is essential to the communities we serve.
As a local business operating in more than 200 countries and territories, we have a responsibility to help protect critical resources.
Our 2030 Water Security Strategy focuses on increasing water security.
We work with partners to provide access to a steady supply of clean water for people and ecosystems in the areas where we operate and source ingredients.
We recently announced a more focused effort to prioritize the most water- stressed regions.
As we’ve done since 2015, we’ll continue to replenish the water we use in our finished beverages to nature and communities.
In 2022, we replenished 159%.
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Packaging: We seek to drive a circular economy for our packaging because this helps to reduce waste and carbon emissions.
We’re working to use more recycled content in our packaging, to expand our use of refillable bottles, and to collect packaging for recycling through our World Without Waste initiative.
We also partner to design new solutions for packaging.
For example, we licensed our technology for a 100% plant-based plastic bottle to a company building a commercial- scale facility in Germany.
This bio-based plastic packaging has a lower carbon footprint than other plastics.
While we’re making progress, we know there is more work to be done.
In 2022, we collected 61% of the equivalent bottles and cans that we introduced into the market and used 15% rPET To galvanize collective action, we invest in solutions and partnerships across industry, governments and society.
In 2022, we became a Strategic Partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.
This group includes companies within key industry sectors that can help drive the transition to a circular economy.
Climate: Our water, packaging and climate goals are interconnected.
For example, by creating a circular economy for packaging, we can lower our carbon footprint.
By approaching water stewardship from a basin perspective, we participate in initiatives that increase communities’ resilience to extreme weather events, alongside our partners.
Our approach to climate is rooted in science, and we’ve set a science-based target to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030, against a 2015 baseline.
As of 2022, we have reduced our emissions by 7% against A COMPANY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS We’re committed to creating a culture of inclusion and belonging and to driving meaningful change in our communities.
By 2030, we aspire to be 50% led by women globally.
Today, 39% of our senior leaders are women.
The Coca-Cola Foundation, the philanthropic arm of The Coca-Cola Company, contributed $94.8 million to 301 organizations around the world in 2022 to help create a better shared future for the communities our business serves.

Our ambitious strategy to drive change through a circular economy for our packaging is called World Without Waste.
This strategy is a global sustainable packaging platform focused on these fundamental goals: Making 100% of our packaging recyclable globally by 2025—and using at least 50% recycled material in our packaging by 2030 (Design); collecting and recycling a bottle or can for each one we sell by 2030 (Collect); and bringing people together to support a healthy, debris-free environment (Partner).

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer NETWORKED CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY TEAM THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT & PARTNERSHIPS During 2022, we undertook a comprehensive review of the highest priority topics for our company, system and stakeholders.
Identifying and prioritizing our material topics, in collaboration with a cross-functional internal team and key external stakeholders, is a foundational step in how we develop our corporate strategy, conduct and evolve our business, and report on progress.
Prior to 2022, our last comprehensive review was conducted in 2019, with refreshes being undertaken in 2020 and 2021 to establish closer alignment between priority topics and business- relevant issues and practices.
Our 2022 review included a robust analysis and broader engagement guided by ERM, a leading sustainability consultancy.
This was followed by interviews with more than 30 internal and external stakeholders and an online survey that had 90 responses from across the globe.
Stakeholders we talked to represent a diversity of views and have deep expertise across a range of issues and sectors.
The stakeholders included investors and financial institutions, NGOs, bottling partners, trade and industry associations, business peers, customers and suppliers.
Our comprehensive 2022 review process resulted in an updated priority topics matrix, which reflects adjustments to several key issues in response to feedback from both internal and The updated matrix continues to demonstrate that our priority topics are Packaging & Circularity and Water Stewardship, followed by Health & Nutrition and Climate Change.
Responsible Sourcing and Talent Attraction, Retention and DEI increased in importance versus the prior year.
We have implemented management initiatives to address these priority topics.
We also continue to evolve our strategic approach to effectively manage associated business risks and opportunities in light of the ongoing changes to both our business and the external context in which we operate.

Approximately 13.5 Billion liters (approx. 7%) of the water used in our beverages that we returned to nature and communities is from 7 projects located in Ukraine and Belarus where since May 2019 we have not been able to monitor projects on intervals aligned with internal guidelines due to COVID and the ongoing war.
3 Many of our water replenishment projects are funded by The Coca-Cola Foundation.
In this section our water leadership work refers to actions by the company, The Coca-Cola Foundation as well as our owned and independent bottling partners and our independent suppliers and partners.
Water is a priority for The Coca-Cola Company because it is essential to life, our beverages and the communities we serve.
It is also critical to public health, food security, biodiversity and the climate crisis.
The world is experiencing increased water insecurity, which is evident through water scarcity, with demands for safe, usable water exceeding supply in certain areas.
We have operations nearly everywhere in the world— in more than 200 countries and territories.
That means we have a responsibility to accelerate our efforts to help address water stress, protect local water resources and help build community climate resilience—communities’ ability to adapt to these changing conditions.
That’s why our 2030 Water Security Strategy is focused on accelerating the actions needed to increase water security where we operate, source ingredients and touch people’s

WATER SECURITY STRATEGY Vision: Our 2030 Water Security Strategy is focused on accelerating the actions needed to increase water security where we operate, source ingredients and touch people’s lives.
We do that by contributing toward sustainable, clean water access that improves livelihoods and We also work to preserve nature and biodiversity as well to promote advanced water Over the last couple of years, we followed a process to segment and prioritize our operating facilities, commercial regions, sourcing regions for global priority ingredients, watersheds, and communities based on those with the highest water-related risks (read more on the following page).
As a result of this work, we have set three key goals designed to achieve our vision: water use across 175 of our facilities identified as facing high levels of water stress Improve the health of as most critical for our supply chain by 2030.
Return a total of 2 trillion liters of water to nature between 2021 and 2030.
To achieve our goals, collective • Use less water • Reuse and treat wastewater • Support nature-based solutions • Invest in landscape solutions • Help farmers use less water and implement • Help provide communities with access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) •
Advocate for good water governance and The Coca-Cola Company and our bottling partners Coca-Cola FEMSA, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners and Arca Continental joined the “Open Call to Accelerate Action on Water”, an initiative of the UN Global Compact, the CEO Water Mandate, and others.
This means we will partner to build water resilience across operations and supply chains, and we will work together to achieve collective positive water impact in at least 100 vulnerable water basins THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT In 2022, we completed our analysis of water- related risks in areas where we can make the greatest impact1.
We prioritized our operating facilities, commercial regions, sourcing regions for global priority ingredients, We analyzed water sourcing risks across approximately 700 operational locations (mainly concentrate plants and bottling facilities) and mapped the minor river basins and sourcing basins of these facilities.
We catalogued these locations based on the detailed mapping and results from an Enterprise Water Risk Assessment from the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct 3.0 tool and from Facility Water As a result, each facility has been placed within one of three categories: 25% of our facilities face the highest level of water-related risks and are on a path to 100% regenerative water use by 2030.
facility locations in a water-stressed context that will drive advanced water efficiency • CONTRIBUTING�LOCATIONS: System facility locations in areas with low water-related risks.
These will contribute to water security overall by implementing the Coca-Cola system's Water Resource Sustainability Standard, achieving industry benchmark water efficiency and 100% compliance with wastewater Similarly, we undertook a comprehensive process to identify priority watersheds across our system.
These include our Leadership Locations and their water sources, where we source global priority ingredients, key growth markets and We also began mapping priority communities, based on their lack of access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and resilience to water- related impacts of climate change (e.g., floods and droughts), with a focus on communities close to our facilities, and/or in urban growth centers where we sell our products, and/ or in rural farming communities where By mapping and overlaying our priority facilities, watersheds and communities, we have developed a framework of prioritization and a deeper understanding of risks, which will help us develop holistic, integrated and context-based approaches to help increase water security where it matters the most in our business, operations and supply chains.
Regenerative water use means facilities must reduce, reuse, recycle and replenish the water used in operations in the local correlated watersheds for beneficial social, economic and/or environmental uses by other stakeholders and nature.
During the course of implementation of our 2030 Water Security Strategy we will review our prioritization periodically, as risks evolve and/or new data emerges.
This may lead to changes in the prioritized facilities, watersheds and communities.
PRIORITIZING OPERATIONS, COMMUNITIES AND WATERSHEDS Prioritizing operations, watersheds and In Türkiye, we identified an operating facility located in a water- stressed area as a priority facility (Leadership Location) in the city of Bursa in the north-west of the country.
The facility is owned and operated by our bottling partner Coca-Cola İçecek.
Further, we identified the Bursa/Balikesir watershed as a priority because it not only serves as a water source for our facility but also because it supports the growing of apples, peaches and nectarines that we source as ingredients in our products.
In addition, we identified seven farming villages in the same province as priority communities, based on their location in ingredient sourcing and key The watershed faces high levels of water scarcity and pollution of water sources from local industries, including textiles and agriculture (e.g., use of insecticides).
Rural farming communities have relatively low levels of access to clean water.
The operating facility is driving water efficiency improvements by conducting a gap assessment against the Coca-Cola system’s Water Resource Sustainability Standard compliance process and working with a third-party consultancy to screen options for improving water efficiency in our operations.
We developed a watershed stewardship plan which includes supporting farmers to improve irrigation efficiency and reduce water contamination, reforestation efforts to help filter water pollution and regulate precipitation and evaporation flows, and helping communities to install rainwater harvesting systems.
In this way we are working to help improve water security by focusing on actions we can take both within and outside our operations to help improve water efficiency and watershed health as well as support local communities and farmers through interventions that are relevant to the local context.
See the Sustainable Agriculture section for more details on how we are supporting farmers to improve water management in growing our ingredients in this region.
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT All our production operations will continue to implement the Coca-Cola system’s Water The purpose of this standard is to identify and reduce water quality- and quantity-related challenges for our operations.
To decrease water use in our operations, we use internal tools such as the Water Efficiency Catalogue, which assesses technical standards (e.g., on-line flow monitoring, water collection and reuse capabilities) and team culture (e.g., training and communication on the importance of water efficiency) regarding water efficiency in our production facilities and provides innovative best practices (e.g., water reuse for package rinsing and water-free lubrication of conveyor belts).
In the development of new plants, we leverage our Sustainability by Design Tool to ensure that water-efficient processes are implemented and that we achieve best-in-class water efficiency.
We have set an ambitious target to reduce our water use ratio by 20% by 2030 from a 2015 baseline for all operations across the system.
We are focused on water efficiency improvements in Leadership Locations and Advanced Efficiency Locations that operate in water-stressed contexts, which has resulted in a water use ratio of 1.79 liters of water used per liter of beverage in 2022.
This is our highest achievement in water efficiency to date and significantly better than the industry average for carbonated soft drinks of 1.91 l/l of beverages.1 We have partnered with denkstatt to develop a “Cost of Water” tool for our teams.
This tool will help us get a better understanding of the cost of water by evaluating the costs associated with potential water risks in addition to the operational costs associated with water use.
Better understanding of these costs will help strengthen decision making and the business case for investment in initiatives that respond In 2022, we also worked with Bluerisk and Valuing Impact and a number of peer companies to better understand how projects returning water to communities and nature help create societal value.
Across the 22 projects analyzed, we learned that these projects not only generated 210 million cubic meters of volumetric water benefits, but also delivered $39 million in societal value, with an average societal return on investment (SROI) of 3.9.
We have a goal to achieve 100% regenerative water use in all our 175 Leadership Locations globally by 2030.
In 2022, we included progress against water replenishment in Leadership Locations as a metric for the Long-Term Incentive (LTI) plan for our executive leadership team.
Over the past year, our Talent and Compensation Committee approved the inclusion of a metric related to water replenishment in Leadership Locations in line with the goals of our 2030 1 2021 BIER (Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable) REDUCING WATER CHALLENGES IN OUR OPERATIONS Within our 18 concentrate production plants, which produce the concentrates used to make many of our sparkling beverages, the company has committed to driving water efficiency improvements.
In 2022, we achieved a 7% average water efficiency improvement across all our concentrate plants compared to a 2015 baseline.
These facilities have worked as a network to review and assess the implementation of best practices and governance of water use, known as “Water Efficiency Maturity Assessments.”
As an example, in 2022, one of our concentrate plants in Ireland reduced its water consumption by more than 13,000 cubic meters compared to the previous year by implementing circular washing in its clean-in-place process.
A monitor-to- improve mindset in our local team is also key to achieving and sustaining this level of performance.
As a member of the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS), we are proud to be a part of a global movement to advance good water stewardship practices.
The AWS certification confirms that the highest global standard for responsible water stewardship has been met in support of social, cultural, environmental and economic benefits at both the site and catchment level.
We plan to certify all our 18 concentrate production sites against the latest AWS Standard by 2025.
10% IMPROVEMENT in water efficiency across all system operations compared In 2022, The Coca-Cola Foundation provided support to Ceres for the Valuing Water Finance Initiative to drive investor leadership on valuing water and to broaden investors’ perspective on the role that water plays in many In Chihuahua, Mexico, we partnered with The Nature Conservancy, a global environmental nonprofit organization, to develop a watershed stewardship plan for the Lago Bustillo y de los Mexicanos watershed.
It was identified as a priority watershed because it supplies water to a manufacturing facility owned by our bottling partner Corporación del Fuerte, which is a Leadership Location.
In addition, the watershed includes orchards from which the system sources apples.
The agricultural sector and the city of Cuauhtémoc are major water users.
The watershed is forecasted to face increasing water quality and quantity challenges in the coming years due to population growth and rising temperatures.
With funding from Fundación Coca-Cola Mexico, our projects in this watershed have helped to improve rural communities’ access to water, mainly through rainwater harvesting systems and check dams.
The watershed stewardship plan completed in 2022 helped identify key context-specific interventions to consider for future projects including, reforestation, rainwater harvesting, dams, plant nurseries, conservation of springs and community access to WASH, as well as the need to strengthen local partnerships.
These plans will also help us to track improvements in watershed health and co- benefits of projects (e.g., enhanced biodiversity and carbon sequestration).
One project currently in the pipeline is working with an agri-tech partner, Kilimo, to help local farmers save water by adopting technology-enabled irrigation management tools.

Insufficient access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure and poor water quality are key challenges faced by communities around the world.
These challenges are being exacerbated by population growth, climate change, political conflict For more than a decade, The Coca-Cola Company has established strong leadership in community water programs with the support of The Coca-Cola Foundation and many nonprofits, governments, customers and other partners.
We are updating our reporting methodology for our community water programming data to align with our 2030 Water Security Strategy and upcoming external frameworks, and we will apply it to future data reporting when ready.
In 2022, our operating units began the identification of priority communities based on communities’ access to WASH and/or their resilience to the impacts of climate change (e.g., floods and droughts).
We aim to support our priority communities in addressing shared water challenges by identifying and implementing 1.
Improving access to safe drinking water, 2.
Enabling adaptation to water-related 3. Ensuring rapid recovery from crises.
We’re working with WASH4Work, an initiative hosted by the CEO Water Mandate, to develop a standardized methodology of accounting for the co-benefits of WASH projects (e.g., health, income, nutrition, safety and security, and education) and strengthen the business case for investments in WASH programs.
INTEGRATING GENDER INTO WASH PROGRAMS
Gender has always been a core focus for our WASH programs because we know that women and girls suffer disproportionately from poor access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene.
In 2018, The Coca-Cola Foundation partnered with Global Water Challenge (GWC), USAID and Ipsos through the Water and Development Alliance (WADA) on a study across three countries in Africa—Nigeria, Rwanda, and Eswatini—of the impact of improved WASH on women’s empowerment.
This “Ripple Effect” study found that improved WASH had positive impacts on a number of important facets of women’s lives including time savings.
The research established that of women who utilized time savings for economic activities, 91% saw an increase in income.
Providing women with greater economic opportunity helps build resilience in their In 2022, we were pleased to build on this work and help develop, along with WaterAid and Diageo, practical guidance to help companies and their implementing partners turn strategic commitments on community WASH and gender equality into integrated projects that result in better, more sustainable outcomes which are critical parts of the pathway to gender equality In Latin America and the Caribbean, 25% of the population lack access to safely managed drinking water
services.1 Climate change, urbanization, accelerated water usage, and inadequate infrastructure are among the leading causes.
In response to this, Coca-Cola Latin America, in alliance with the Global Environment Technology Foundation (GETF) and local civil society organizations, designed and launched a platform called Aliados por el Agua (Aliados) to help improve access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) for 2 million people across 18 countries by 2030.
In 2022, Aliados implemented more than 30 projects across 12 countries, in partnership with 26 civil society organizations, as well as local municipalities, utility providers and communities, and funding from The Coca-Cola Foundation.
In addition, Coca-Cola Latin America partnered with Global Water Challenge and its women for water platform to develop the�Women�for�Water�Framework�for�Action—which is based on the Ripple Effect Study—and helps to integrate gender and women’s empowerment into the Aliados por el Agua platform by focusing projects on three key areas: income generation, health and With our partners and support from The Coca-Cola Foundation, we are piloting the framework across four projects in Mexico, Bolivia and Brazil to empower women through water-related programming.

In 2022, we partnered with the CEO Water Mandate, denkstatt and others to help build the business case for NBS by developing a standardized methodology to measure benefit accrual and a means to value social return on investment.
The methodology has been tested across several of our water replenishment projects in key geographies.
This valuation methodology supports the broader Benefit Accounting of Nature-Based Solutions for Watersheds project, including The NBS Benefits Explorer tool, led by the Pacific Institute and CEO Water Mandate, in partnership with The Nature Conservancy and LimnoTech.
Our aim is to support public, private and non-profit sectors in developing effective policies and programs to incentivize greater implementation of and investment in NBS because water is at the nexus of many goals, including protecting habitats, increasing biodiversity, sequestering carbon and promoting community resilience in the face of The Ipo Watershed in Bulacan in the Philippines supplies water to Metro Manila, the second most populous region of the country.
Forest cover within the watershed has dramatically dropped from 85% to just 40% in recent years1 due to illegal logging and unsustainable forest practices, which has resulted in a reduction in the natural water storage capacity of the basin.
Malnutrition is also a pervasive challenge in local communities.
Since 2016, The Coca-Cola Foundation and Coca-Cola Foundation Philippines have worked in partnership with WWF-Philippines to protect rainforests of the area, replant trees and provide livelihood opportunities.
The project has reforested 165 hectares of degraded land in the watershed and supported local communities to start household gardens to grow food.
In 2022 the project was assessed using the NBS valuation methodology.
Overall, the project provided a very positive return on social investment and its specific co-benefits included: • WATER�QUANTITY:
The replenishment of approximately 400 million liters of water per year due to decreased runoff and improved water access for local communities.
Approximately 2,500 metric tons of CO2e per year from reforestation.
Household gardens helped to tackle food insecurity and some of the trees planted have edible fruits

In June 2021, as part of the EU Code of Conduct for Responsible Food Business and Marketing Practices, we joined a UNESDA Soft Drinks Europe pledge to reduce the sugar in our drinks by an additional 10% by 2025, which will represent a 33% average sugar reduction when completed by 2025 compared to 2000.
The European soft drinks sector is the only sector to have made an additional sugar reduction commitment under the EU Code of Conduct.
By 2025, we aim for 50% of the drinks we sell in Europe to be low- and no-calorie drinks (we’re currently at 45%) in support of the strategy to accelerate the transition to sustainable food systems.
We’re offering more low- and no- calorie options in more places.
For example, 99.7% of U.S. outlets carry our low- and zero-sugar SKUs—and, on average, 24 zero-sugar sparkling soft drink SKUs are found per store.1 tons of added sugar removed from our global 19 OF TOP 20 or zero-sugar, or have a tons of added sugar removed on an annualized of the products in our less than 100 calories per recipe changes to reduce added sugar in 2022 of our volume sold in 2022 was low- or no-calorie low- or no-sugar products THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Several of our core brands took creative approaches to promoting zero-calorie choices to younger consumers in 2022 through flavor innovations, packaging designs and digital experiences.
The global Coca-Cola Creations platform introduced a series of limited-edition offerings inspired by consumer passion points of music, gaming and sports—starting with the outer space-inspired Coca-Cola Starlight, which offered fans a taste of outer space.
In the United States, a limited-edition lineup of mysteriously flavored Fanta beverages was anchored by One of the ways we achieve great taste without sugar is by using low- and no-calorie sweeteners.
We only use sugar alternatives that have been thoroughly tested through scientific studies and confirmed as safe by globally recognized food safety authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ).
When used as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle, we believe the science shows that sugar alternatives can help meet public health recommendations to reduce added sugar.
Additionally, food additives such as non-sugar sweeteners help make food systems more sustainable by both reducing sugar and lowering our carbon emissions.
Our recent efforts have focused on collaborating with an ecosystem of suppliers and research organizations to develop, continuously improve and commercially scale stevia and other naturally derived sugar alternatives.
A global list of more than 70 published journal articles dating back to 2008, reflecting research we have directly funded or authored, can be found on our website.
We continue to use our marketing to drive growth of our low- and no-calorie portfolio.
Coca-Cola Zero Sugar has delivered double- digit volume growth in five of the last six years.
In 2022, several leading low- and no-calorie brands in North America launched consumer campaigns with celebrity partners and Sprite�Zero�Sugar teamed up with Marvel Studios’ Black Panther: Wakanda Forever for the “Infinite Potential.

In 2022, we launched Jack Daniel’s & Coca-Cola in Mexico, with more markets to follow in 2023 through our relationship with Brown-Forman.
Jack Daniel’s & Coca-Cola joins our growing portfolio of ARTD offerings including Lemon-Dou, Topo Chico Hard Seltzer and Schweppes Pre-Mixed Cocktails.
In the United States, we authorize third parties to produce and sell Topo Chico Hard Seltzer, Simply Spiked Lemonade and Fresca Mixed.
Recognizing the risks associated with alcohol consumption, we created guardrails outlined in our Global Policy on Alcohol Responsibility to ensure we grow our alcohol brands in a responsible and sustainable way.
The policy articulates our commitment to: 1.
Ensure the responsible marketing of our alcohol brands; 2.
Support local responsible consumption partnerships and communications programs to help reduce the harmful use of alcohol; 3. Provide tools and information to enable people to make informed choices; and 4.
Enable our employees and partners to be ambassadors for responsible consumption.
Our responsible alcohol marketing policy determines how we innovate and bring to market ARTD brands.
This policy has been reviewed by the World Federation of Advertisers and endorsed by the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking.
At the heart of our approach is ensuring that our alcohol brands are only directed at adults over the legal purchasing age who choose to drink, and encouraging only drinking in moderation.
This means our brands will never be directed to minors below the legal purchasing age.
We run regular trainings for our people and our partners, and always apply the appropriate safeguards across all channels of communications and sales.
In 2022, we joined the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking (IARD), a consortium of leading beer, wine and spirits producers committed to reducing harmful drinking and promoting moderation through robust responsibility standards.
In Brazil, we are working with three NGO partners on the Pega Leve (“Take it Easy”) program, which promotes moderation by communicating the risks of drinking and driving and excessive consumption, with a focus on The Coca-Cola Company is also a member of Drinkwise in Australia and Drinkaware in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, which are independent not-for- profit organizations that work with partners and members to reduce alcohol-related harm in those countries.
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT We are committed to providing transparent nutrition information about all of our products, in line with local regulations, so consumers can make informed decisions.
We were the first beverage company to place calorie information on the front of nearly all our packaging worldwide.
Today, we provide nutrition information on product labels, with the exception of certain returnable bottles, fountain beverages and waters (unsweetened, unflavored).
For these beverage and packaging types, we offer nutrition information through websites We respect the role of parents and caregivers as the primary decision-makers for what their children drink, and we do not market any of our products directly to children under 13, regardless of nutritional profile.
Effective January 1, 2022, we raised the age threshold from under 12 to under 13 and reduced the audience threshold from 35% to 30%.
This means we will not place our marketing or advertising in any media, platform or event where more than 30% of the audience is under 13.
Our policy goes beyond media and includes packaging, in-store and point of sale.
Our approach is consistent with the International Chamber of Commerce Marketing & Advertising Code and its Framework for Responsible Food and Beverage Marketing Communication.
We hold everyone involved in our marketing and communications accountable to our Global Responsible Marketing Policy, from employees and bottling partners to agency and media partners.
We are a founding member of the International Food & Beverage Alliance (IFBA), a group of leading companies that self-regulate globally on responsible marketing to children.
Additionally, we collaborate with industry peers at regional and local levels to scale collective action in responsible marketing pledge programs.
People can enjoy our drinks in sizes that help control portions and added sugar intake.
These include 7.5-oz. mini cans and 8-oz. glass bottles in many markets.
We continue to expand availability of these packages and introduce newer offerings, including 150-ml mini cans and 250-ml slim cans, so people can enjoy the same great tastes in sizes that are right for them.
In 2022, we kicked off a pilot of a Coca-Cola Freestyle compact fountain dispenser at on-the- go and at-work locations in France, Belgium, Great Britain and the Netherlands.
In addition to giving consumers an expanded array of personalized, on-demand beverage choices—including low- and no-calorie options—the innovation helps reduce our carbon and packaging footprints.
Today, about 44% of our sparkling soft drink brands come in packages of 8.5 ounces or less.
In North America, 10-pack mini cans grew 39% in 2022.
In this section, our packaging strategy refers to actions by the company as well as our owned and independent bottling partners and our independent WORKING TOWARD A WORLD WITHOUT WASTE We recognize our responsibility to help solve complex plastic waste challenges facing our planet and society.
That’s why, in 2018, we launched an ambitious strategy called World Without Waste to drive systemic change through a circular economy for our packaging.
World Without Waste is a global sustainable packaging platform focused on measurable and interconnected goals, each of which are supported • Making 100% of our packaging recyclable globally by 2025—and using at least 50% recycled material in our packaging by 2030 (DESIGN); • Collecting and recycling a bottle or can for each one we sell by 2030 (COLLECT); • Bringing people together to support a healthy, THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT IN 2022, WE ANNOUNCED A NEW GLOBAL REUSABLE PACKAGING GOAL.
BY 2030, WE AIM TO HAVE AT LEAST RETURNABLE
GLASS OR PLASTIC BOTTLES OR IN FOUNTAIN DISPENSERS ONE OF OUR PACKAGING DESIGN GOALS IS TO REDUCE OUR USE OF VIRGIN PLASTIC DERIVED BETWEEN 2020 AND 2025 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT We are making progress against each of our objectives, which are embedded in how we operate as a business, and we are taking a transparent approach to reporting our actions, results and learnings.
Our work has also shown us where the major challenges are, and some of our markets will have challenges meeting goals as quickly as others.
Because packaging accounts for approximately 30% of our carbon footprint, nearly all of our World Without Waste efforts align with our 2030 science-based climate target and net zero ambition.
When we lightweight our packaging, incorporate more recycled and bio-based material, invest in local recycling programs and increase our use of reusable packaging, we can reduce both waste and our greenhouse WORLD WITHOUT WASTE: DESIGN We deliver our beverages in a variety of packaging formats—from glass and PET bottles, to aluminum cans, to refillable packaging.
Just as we offer drink choices for a range of occasions, our packaging portfolio gives consumers multiple ways to enjoy our brands Since glass, aluminum and PET plastic are all recyclable materials, they all can play a role in a circular economy.
Refillable packages, both glass and plastic, can have the lowest carbon footprints of our packaging options.
PET packages with recycled content can have a lower carbon footprint than aluminum and glass, which require more energy to produce, recycle • In Scotland, Costa Limited (“Costa”) carried out a 14-store pilot of an on-the-go reusable cup scheme, which invited consumers to rent a cup by scanning a QR code before enjoying their drink and then returning the cup for it to be washed and reused.
The effort supports Costa’s global goal for 25% of its drinks to be served in reusable or refillable packaging by 2030.
We tailor our refillable packaging approach by market, based on local conditions.
In 2023, we launched an end-to-end refillables operations guide to help local teams implement more effective strategies and plans.
Our Design goals establish a foundation for enabling a circular economy for our packaging materials.
Creating a circular economy requires designing out waste by using, collecting and reusing recycled materials, which have inherent value.
It also means embracing refillable and Reusable packaging can reduce single-use packaging waste.
Expanding refillable packaging options helps ensure high levels of collection of beverage containers.
In 2022, we were proud to announce an industry-leading goal to have at least 25% of our beverage volume worldwide sold in refillable/returnable glass or plastic bottles or in fountain dispensers with reusable packaging by 2030.
We continue to test and scale returnable glass bottle (RGB) and reusable PET pilot •
In Latin�America, the “Let’s Be Different” campaign kicked off on World Environment Day 2022, inviting consumers to trade any recyclable PET bottle for a refillable bottle of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.
In Brazil, returnable, refillable PET bottles of Coca-Cola, Fanta and Sprite can be returned, cleaned and refilled up to 25 times.
The package gives shoppers an affordable option and drives repurchase rates.
• In France, a 250-ml returnable glass bottle (RGB) launched in hotels, restaurants and cafes for Fuze Tea, Tropico, Sprite, Fanta and Minute Maid.
Additionally, Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar are now offered in RGBs nationwide, eliminating more than 15 million single-use glass bottles in 2022.
• In the United�States, a 500-ml returnable glass bottle pilot program in approximately 100 retail and foodservice outlets in El Paso, Texas, generated a 75% return rate, and we are exploring expansion capabilities in 2023.
We also are working with Reuse Seattle to reduce single-use plastic waste by encouraging customers to transition to reusable cups for our dispensed products, as part of a broader multi- stakeholder effort on foodservice packaging across the metro region.
• In South�Africa, we extended the rollout of refillable 2-liter and 1.5-liter PET plastic bottles.
• In Sri�Lanka, we responded to the ongoing economic crisis by introducing the Large Returnable Glass Bottle (LRGB), nicknamed the “Big Buddy Pack,” to provide an affordable and returnable, mealtime-focused option for families.
Coca-Cola, Fanta and Sprite are offered in the 750-ml bottles, which feature paper labels and aluminum caps.
• In Sweden, we are collaborating with Reitan Convenience on a reusable packaging pilot in Stockholm.
Shoppers who visit the sustainability- focused PDX store can choose from more than 60 fountain beverages, many of which are not available in bottles or cans.
Shoppers are encouraged to bring their own refillable vessels or purchase a reusable stainless steel tumbler.
• In Hong�Kong,�China, we have installed almost 100 Bonaqua Water Stations along hiking trails and in shopping malls and transportation hubs.
Consumers pay a small fee to fill their own bottles with hot or cold Bonaqua water.

We are pursuing this goal, which represents about 20% of our virgin plastic use, through more than 150 lightweighting projects and advancements on use of recycled In 2022, we avoided around half a million metric tons of virgin plastic usage through these efforts with an incremental avoidance of over 50,000 metric tons since last year.
However, growth of plastic packaging has outpaced efforts on lightweighting and use of recycled content, so that we have not reduced our use of MOVING TOWARD 100% rPET1 Demand for recycled PET plastic for food-grade applications currently exceeds supply, so we need to help build a sustainable pipeline of high-quality material.
We work with communities to boost PET recycling and collection; collaborate with recycling partners; and secure rPET to help ensure material for our bottles is used again and again.
In recent years, system partners and suppliers have announced significant investments, both individually and through joint ventures, to boost the global rPET infrastructure.
Many investments are coming online in the next two years and will change the rPET landscape, particularly in Asia.
We continue to work with industry peers to advocate for government regulations permitting the use of rPET in food and beverage packaging.
Notable countries with food-grade recycled plastics acceptance standards for use in 1 Except where otherwise indicated, where reference is made in this report to 100% Recycled PET, 100% rPET, or 100% Recycled Plastic Beverage Packaging, we are referring to the material from which the plastic bottle is made, not the cap and label.
beverages now include Bahrain, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kuwait, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Thailand and Yemen.
Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines Inc. and Indorama Ventures—the world’s largest recycled PET flake producer—began operations at the new PETValue recycling facility.
The country’s first bottle-to-bottle production site will process 2 billion clear PET plastic bottles into new bottles for Coca-Cola brands.
Indorama Ventures will open a similar facility in Indonesia in 2023.
Around the world, many of our biggest brands are taking major steps to support a circular economy for plastic packaging.
More than 40 markets currently offer at least one brand in 100% rPET packaging.
A few highlights from 2022 include: • In the United�States�and�Canada, we recently began offering the majority of DASANI bottles— from 20-oz. and 1.5-liter singles to 10-oz. and 12-oz. multipacks—in 100% rPET plastic.
The shift supports the DASANI brand's pledge to remove the equivalent of 2 billion virgin plastic bottles from production by 2027 compared to 2021 levels.
The announcement followed the launch of 100% rPET bottles in New York, California and Texas, which also included Coca-Cola 20- oz. bottles.
Bold, on-pack labels drive consumer awareness with “100% Recycled Bottle” and “Recycle Me Again” calls to action.
• Eight markets in Europe (Austria, Belgium, Iceland, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland) offer their entire locally produced portfolios in 100% rPET.
• In Qatar, Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta and Arwa water were sold in 100% rPET bottles in FIFA World Cup 2022 stadiums and fan zones.
This marked both the FIFA World Cup debut of the sustainable packaging format and the Middle East’s first 100% rPET rollout.
Dedicated recycling bins and on-site communication ensured proper collection of all bottles to be recycled and converted locally back into new ones, closing the loop and leaving behind a green legacy.
Through joint ventures and long-term supplier agreements, our system is making strategic investments to boost recycling capacity, unlock new supplies of recycled plastic and scale new technologies.
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT • In Vietnam, we launched 100% rPET
Coca-Cola bottles, which is projected to avoid 2,000 metric tons of virgin plastic usage annually.
• In Japan, we achieved our World Without Waste goal of 50% recycled material use in Q1 2022.
Four brands are now offered in 100% recycled PET and supported by an educational SPRITE TRANSITIONS FROM GREEN We continued to transition Sprite plastic bottles from green to clear PET to help increase the efficiency of recycling systems.
The move, which the brand has completed or is in process in over 100 countries, improves the efficiency of recycling systems and boosts availability of food-grade rPET.
As one example, Coca-Cola North America’s entire green plastic portfolio—including packaging for Sprite, Fresca, Seagram’s and Mello Yello— made the transition to clear PET in 2022.
We continue to deliver breakthrough technologies to lightweight our plastic packaging: Label-less�bottles are now available across a range of brands in Japan, South Korea and China.
Laser engraving technology used directly on the bottle helps improve recyclability and We licensed our technology for a 100%�plant- based�plastic�bottle to a company building a commercial-scale facility in Germany, which is scheduled to deliver material in 2023.
Bio-based plastic packaging has a lower carbon footprint than petroleum-based plastic packaging.
Bottles with tethered�caps, which enable bottles and caps to be collected together for recycling, are being piloted for our entire portfolio in Germany, Bulgaria and Italy.
Additionally, a new lightweighted bottle neck finish in Europe will save an estimated 9,100 tons of plastic per year by 2024.
The KeelClip®1�packaging�solution made from recyclable cardboard replaces plastic rings for multi-packs.
Following a successful rollout across Europe, the first-of-its-kind solution is being piloted in select U.S. markets.

As The Coca-Cola Company’s second-largest brand, Sprite is proud to demonstrate its commitment to circularity through our packaging by ensuring every bottle we make can be recycled and made into a new one.
We can only achieve our World Without Waste goals by creating closed-loop packaging streams, and that starts with clear PET.”
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT WORLD WITHOUT WASTE:
COLLECT We work with partners across business, government and civil society to create or support closed-loop systems that ensure our packages are collected and recycled or reused.
Delivering a circular economy will require significant and urgent improvement in waste management and recycling systems around the world.
Preserving the inherent economic value of our packaging—and ensuring circularity— requires robust collection and recycling systems Collection challenges vary, as every country has unique governments, regulatory environments and consumer behaviors.
Though some countries have high recycling rates across packaging types, in many regions the recycling rate for PET bottles lags that of some other materials.
While we continue to focus on national collection rates, in 2022, with input from key external stakeholders, we updated our collection tracking guidance to account for material collected through system- led efforts.
Company and bottler teams in markets with limited recycling infrastructures (including parts of Latin America, Africa and Asia) are financing system-led collection initiatives to supplement national systems and are launching our own tracking systems.
In 2023, we will start incorporating Coca-Cola system-led collection data into our aggregate numbers.
a bottle or can for each one we sell 1 The collection rate represents a weighted average of national collection rates, collected for recycling rates or refillable rates by packaging type to TCCS’s sales in units to express the percent of equivalent bottles and cans introduced into the market that were collected and refilled or collected for recycling for the year.
In emerging markets, we advocate for government regulations permitting the use of rPET in food and beverage packaging, and we seek ways to empower the informal waste collection sector in the circular economy.
In developed markets, we are working with industry peers to build collection infrastructures— including our more than 40 years of experience operating 40+ local Deposit Return Systems (DRS).
Countries with a well-designed DRS scheme, like Germany, can achieve high levels of collection (approximately 95% collection for PET Collection Rates by Packaging Type1 of the equivalent bottles and cans we introduced into the market in 2022 were collected and refilled or collected for recycling.1 REFILLABLE GLASS & PET PLASTIC THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT We advocate for well-designed Extended� Producer�Responsibility (EPR) schemes, in which companies that produce packaging fund collection, sorting and recycling with the goal of increasing recycling rates.
Recognizing that industry cannot achieve a circular economy on its own, we are part of a Consumer Goods Forum (CGF) coalition of 40 companies supporting the development of EPR programs in collaboration with governments.
The coalition has published guiding principles and key design parameters for In the United States, we’re making progress one community at a time, through our industry initiative Every Bottle Back.
As of November 2022, the initiative has launched over 25 projects which are projected to collect and capture nearly 700 million pounds of PET over ten years.
We also work with peers and partners to advocate for legislation that enables a circular economy, like a recent EPR law passed in Colorado and minimum recycled content laws passed in California, Washington and New Jersey.
However, collection rates in the United States trail those of many other countries, and we know there is much more work to do.
Ensuring respect for the human rights of vulnerable workers in the informal waste sector is an important pillar of our Collection efforts.
Over the last two years, we have partnered with industry peers and Tearfund, an NGO advocating for improved livelihoods for informal waste sector workers, on the Fair Circularity Initiative to develop human rights principles and guidelines for engaging with the informal waste collection industry.
For more information, see the Human Rights section.
• In the Philippines, we partnered with the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority to pilot a certified skills training program for workers in the informal waste collection sector.
These workers have access to training, tools and equipment for efficient waste collection and connections to materials recovery facilities (MRF) that buy the waste that is collected.
We also are creating more than 2,000 collection hubs in sari-sari (convenience) stores and other retail outlets where community members can drop off used, clear PET bottles in return for incentives.
Participating retailers earn income from selling collected PET bottles to waste management companies and recyclers.
Similar programs are in place in Malaysia, • In Brazil, SustentaPET collection centers take in more than 700,000 PET bottles a day to produce recycled resin that ultimately becomes new packaging.
In its first three years, the program has recycled more than 83,000 metric tons of PET—and will expand to additional states in 2023.
• In Egypt, we partner with BariQ, the largest bottle-to-bottle recycling plant in the Middle East, to recycle 14,000 metric tons of plastic waste annually to food-grade product compatible with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Egyptian Organization for Standardization (EOS).
• In India, we’re teaming with bicycle grocery delivery service Zepto for the “PET Return and Recycle” initiative.
Using the Zepto mobile app, consumers can return up to four empty PET bottles (across any brand) to be collected by Zepto riders during home delivery trips.
Following a successful pilot in Mumbai, the program will expand to additional cities.

PARTNER Tackling the global plastic waste crisis requires cross-sector collaboration and alignment on common principles and targets.
We work with a range of stakeholders at a global, regional and local level.
This includes partnering with governments and community organizations to strengthen recycling infrastructures and boost collection rates; collaborating with customers, peers and industry associations to shape public policy that supports a circular economy; and teaming up with suppliers, startups and R&D partners to fuel sustainable packaging innovation.
In 2022, we enhanced our partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation by becoming a Strategic Partner alongside some of the world’s largest and most influential organizations, with transformative potential to demonstrate what’s possible in the transition to a circular economy.
As a Strategic Partner we support the Foundation’s mission to develop and promote a circular economy beyond our work on plastics and deepen our engagement globally, We have been working with the Foundation on plastics across a range of projects and initiatives, including as a signatory to their Global Commitment in collaboration with the UN Environment Programme.
In the past couple of years, we increased our ambition and set virgin plastics reduction and reusable packaging In September 2022, we also joined the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty convened by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and WWF, and we have an active role as a Co-Chair of the Coalition’s Policy Working Group.
Over 80 organizations, including businesses from across the plastics value chain, financial institutions and NGOs, are supporting the development of an ambitious, effective and legally binding UN treaty to end plastic pollution—which will set common goals, rules and obligations for member states, and in turn, for businesses.
Through a shared vision we believe that a legally binding treaty must set the right enabling conditions to successfully scale a circular economy for plastic and end plastic pollution, and in doing so, will level the playing field across countries and industries.
This will help ensure all plastics users participate in the funding of collection systems and will set consistent targets for areas such as recyclability, recycled We continue to play an active role in the AB� InBev�100+�Accelerator�program, a global open innovation program committed to crowdsourcing and piloting sustainability-focused startups and solutions.
The program’s 2022 cohort is supporting 46 startups with funding, training, mentoring and other hands-on support to execute pilot projects in a partner company’s supply chain.
Within the Coca-Cola system, we are pursuing six pilot projects, building on the five pilots from last year.
We have focused our investments in concepts that support a circular economy, water and climate.
And while we are early in the process, we are seeing promise.
Pilot projects from the last cycle (2021–2022) with ReciVeci (Ecuador) and RecyclePoints (Nigeria) resulted in ongoing partnerships that are helping to further our World Without Waste plans.
In the Philippines, we are partnering with Save Philippine Seas on a campaign to find and scale community-based plastic waste solutions.
In 2022, five startups—Barrio Studios, Sagip Kalikasan, KAKASIE Eco-Park, #RefillNotLandfill and Alon and Araw—received grants from The Coca-Cola Foundation to advance their collection, recycling and education projects.
In Morocco, we are collaborating with WWF on the Plastic Smart Cities project, which brings together cities and tourism destinations to fight plastic pollution.
The partnership in Tangier aims to reduce leakage of plastic waste into nature by 30%.
In 2021 and 2022, the partners and the local waste management department have collected more than 3,900 metric tons of plastic waste.
We look forward to partnering with more like- minded organizations and communities to make the vision of a World Without Waste a reality.
We now have five years of experience implementing the World Without Waste program.
With targets for both 2025 and 2030, in 2023 we are taking stock of our current status across markets to ensure our local teams have the plans and investments in place to continue to make progress.
Our experience in a handful of markets that are already achieving high performance against specific goals, or the full suite of targets, indicates that these goals can be met.
However, we are not currently on track to meet the World Without Waste targets for 2030.
Package design and the use of recycled materials are areas that are ultimately in our control, but costs, quality, technology and consumer preferences are dynamic factors that affect our ability and timelines for implementation.
The key challenge for us is collection for recycling of beverage packaging, which is the key step to ensure a We will continue to invest in innovation for the small percentage of our packaging that currently has recycling challenges, including juice pouches, opaque packaging currently used for dairy beverages, and cartons.
And, we will invest in new recycling technologies for PET plastic and other packaging materials.
We see a significant opportunity to work more proactively with global and regional customers, many of which have announced their own sustainable packaging goals that can only be achieved in collaboration with key suppliers.
Looking ahead, we will build on our longstanding relationships to make collective progress.

A circular economy helps reduce GHG emissions.
We are incorporating more our packaging, investing in recycling infrastructure and using more reusable packaging.
In 2023, we are building our capabilities in life cycle assessment (LCA) to further drive synergies between our work on We work with our agricultural suppliers to increase energy efficiency and realize carbon sequestration benefits from Nature-Based Solutions (NBS).
We also work with leading sustainable sourcing schemes to quantify the impact of sustainable sourcing on emissions reduction.
See Sustainable Agriculture for more.
We provide system guidance to improve energy efficiency and increase the generation and purchase of renewable energy.
In 2022, there has been new renewable energy generation at system bottling plants in Europe, Latin America, the Philippines, India and the We’re working to increase fuel efficiency and the use of hybrid and electric vehicles across the system.
(CCEP) increased their use of hybrid and electric cars and vans in Europe from 12% in 2021 to 20% in 2022 and introduced 30 electric trucks to make last mile deliveries to customers in Belgium, covering approximately 40% of the country’s local delivery routes.
We are continuing to replace older (HFC)-free and more energy-efficient coolers.
In 2022, 88% of all new coolers placed were HFC-free.
This is an increase from 61% of coolers placed in 2016.
We are working to reduce our carbon footprint in line with science to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
We do this by analyzing and prioritizing the sources of GHG emissions across our value chain and by partnering with stakeholders to drive As of 2022, we reduced our emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 7%,1 making progress toward our science-based reduction target of 25% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline1.
Our ambition is to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
Several of our bottling partners have announced their own science-based targets and net zero pledges to drive climate action across the In 2022, our scope 1 emissions were 4.4 million metric tons, scope 2 emissions were 3.5 million metric tons2 and scope 3 emissions were 57.0
We are part of a number of business networks that are supporting our journey to net zero.
As a member of the WWF Climate Business Network, we share best practices to drive collective ambition and scale action together.
Participation in the Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA) allows us to help deploy market and policy solutions toward a carbon-free energy system.
Membership in Ceres’ Company Network has helped to identify opportunities to drive further progress toward net zero emissions.
The Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee of our Board of Directors oversees climate-related issues.
The Committee assists our Board in overseeing the company’s environmental, social, legislative, regulatory and public policy matters, including progress against our science-based emissions reduction target.
The committee reports regularly to the full Board on these and other matters.
To learn more about our governance structure, see the Governance section.

UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM SOURCES Processing of sold products THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Our Risk Steering Committee oversees regular system-wide risk assessments.
We integrate climate risk planning into this cross-functional and cross-company Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process.
We regularly evaluate commodity- specific risks and resilience associated with climate impacts on water and our supply chain.
Risks that could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations are disclosed in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.
This includes risks related to the effects of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change.
Our management team works to mitigate these risks through, among other things, business continuity planning, setting targets that drive efficiency and making investments to improve our performance and increase resilience.
Ultimately, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee of our Board of Directors oversees climate-related risks.
The involvement of our bottling partners and suppliers is essential to achieving our science- based target to reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030.
The following are examples of how we are working on climate initiatives with partners across our value chain.
INCREASING RENEWABLE ENERGY (ELECTRICITY)
One critical strategy for reducing emissions in our system is the increased use of renewable energy in our manufacturing processes.
Renewable electricity usage, which was third- party assured for the first time in 2021, increased from 12% in 2021 to 21% in 2022.
To build knowledge across our system and increase the generation, procurement and accurate reporting of renewable energy, we published a Renewable Energy Implementation Guidebook in March 2022.
This guidebook provides a step-by-step process for associates across the system to implement on-site solar photovoltaic and solar hot water and steam systems, on-site and off-site renewable energy power purchase agreements (PPAs), coupled with energy attribute certificates to align with GHG Protocol Scope 2 quality criteria.
In addition to the guidebook, we launched a future-facing initiative called the Renewable Energy Project Pipeline in 2022, where we work closely with bottling partners to increase the number of renewable energy projects throughout our system.
Approximately 20 bottling partners and 13 concentrate plants have developed 2023–2025 renewable energy plans.
As the number and scope of these projects expands, we will look for opportunities to collaborate and share best practices.
Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP) in Australia signed an eight-year agreement with Alinta Energy, which includes large-scale generation certificates and 13,000 MWh per year of renewable electricity supplied from the Yandin Wind Farm.
The long-term agreement started in January 2023 and will help CCEP move closer to its goal of using 100% renewable electricity across all of its markets by 2030.
BOTTLING PARTNERS SET SCIENCE-BASED Given the size of our network of bottling partners, they are critically important in making progress toward our climate ambitions.
Our bottling partners have a major influence on emissions reductions based on what they buy, make and deliver for our shared customers In September 2022, Arca Continental committed to setting a science-based target.
This adds to the growing list of our bottlers with approved emissions reductions goals through the Science- Based Targets initiative (SBTi).
This list includes Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company (CCHBC), Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP), AB Inbev, Swire Coca-Cola Limited and Coca-Cola FEMSA.
We will be working to grow this list in 2023.
ENGAGING WITH SUPPLIERS TO TAKE ACTION We continue to find new ways to collaborate and support our suppliers to collectively In 2022, we joined the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LoCT) initiative, led by Guidehouse along with 18 other companies to mobilize collective climate action by providing suppliers with resources, tools and knowledge to accelerate their decarbonization.
As of the end of 2022, there were 94 suppliers to the Coca-Cola system participating in the initiative.
The company is directly sponsoring 56 of these suppliers.
The program is showing signs of success—10 suppliers that we sponsored, who successfully completed the program, have since set or committed to setting their own SBTi-
In total, more than 160 of our suppliers have set or committed to setting SBTi-approved Coolers have long been a key opportunity because approximately one-third of our emissions comes from cold-drink equipment and dispensing.
In early 2023, building on analysis we conducted in 2022, we published internal guidance for coolers used across our value chain.
The guidance sets specific energy usage limits, which will require increasing energy efficiency between now and 2030 and help drive the replacement of older, less efficient coolers.
We are also installing more “intelligent connected” coolers that can transmit data such as product throughput, maintenance status, temperature and energy use, which has operational benefits in addition to In 2022, 88% of all new coolers placed were HFC-free.
This is an increase from 61% of coolers Thanks to The Coca-Cola Company, in April 2022 we had the great opportunity to join the Supplier LoCT initiative.
This program helped us to improve the way we calculate our Scope 1 & 2 emissions and to calculate our Scope 3 emissions for the first time.
Last November, we committed to setting a science-based emissions target.”
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT
In line with the launch of the SBTi’s Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) requirements, we are working to update our current science-based target in line with this methodology and a more ambitious trajectory.
This new target would consider emissions from land use change in our supply chain as part of our overall GHG footprint and would consider carbon sequestration from land-based projects we implement in our supply chain.
While we already work closely with suppliers to engage on water and sustainable agriculture, accounting for land use emissions would require an even closer partnership with our agricultural suppliers.
As we incorporate more work across the agricultural supply chain, this would also help us meet evolving climate risk and data disclosure requirements.
The World Economic Forum’s Global Lighthouse Network recognized The manufacturing facility in Ballina, Ireland, as a manufacturer showing leadership in applying Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies at scale to drive step-change financial, operational and sustainability improvements by transforming factories, value chains and business models.
Investments in the facility’s IT infrastructure, advanced technologies and employee training has led to a 6.8% increase in production in three years (2019–2022) and a 29% energy reduction, which brought emissions back to 2011 levels.
The Ballina team’s learnings are IMPROVING DATA SCOPE AND ACCURACY Gathering complete and accurate data is critical to identifying a path to achieving our science- based target.
We are continuously improving the scope and detail of our data collection to ensure all significant sources of emissions across our value chain are included in our inventory.
We are updating our 2015 baseline data due to recent acquisitions.
Improving our data helps us prioritize projects and programs with the greatest impact, including more detail on renewable energy usage and more data from suppliers.
One area of focus has been to validate the accuracy and completeness of our renewable energy claims.
We have done this through assuring our claims to the GHG Protocol.
This work began in 2021 and continued through 2022.
Because approximately 85% of our total carbon emissions come from goods and services we buy, it is essential to engage with suppliers to accurately capture our full scope 3 emissions and ensure our suppliers join our decarbonization journey.
Each year, we encourage key suppliers to complete CDP’s Supply Chain Climate Change questionnaire, which provides useful data on GHG emissions in our supply chain and information on supplier targets and initiatives to reduce emissions.
In 2022, 378 suppliers provided climate data to CDP out of 495 requested, a 12% increase from 2021.
Additionally, we are working to improve data accuracy in partnership with several major suppliers across ingredients and packaging, starting with sugar and aluminum, in order to develop supplier-specific emissions factors for the commodities we procure.
This allows us to better understand our supply chain, drive change and more accurately track emissions reductions of specific suppliers and commodities in key areas.
Even deeper in our supply chain, work is underway to map and understand how land, water use and farming practices in our major agricultural sourcing regions both generate emissions and have the potential to reduce emissions.
Costa began its own work in 2022, launching a Climate Smart coffee project in partnership with the Rainforest Alliance.
Phase 1 of the project has been to conduct a GHG feasibility study to better understand the carbon footprint of coffee farms from Costa’s key sourcing origins, including Colombia and Brazil.
This study is being used to inform the design of scalable climate mitigation interventions.
1 Leader standard represents supply volume verified to a company-approved, third-party validation, that is aligned with our PSA.
In this section our Sustainable Agriculture work refers to actions by the company as well as our owned and independent bottling partners and our independent Our products and some of our packaging are made from a wide variety of agricultural ingredients which we source from around the world.
Our goal is to sustainably source all our ingredients over time.
We publicly report on our 12 global priority ingredients—such as sugar, corn, fruit, coffee, tea and soybeans.
Sustainably sourcing our ingredients increases the resilience of our supply chain, helps to conserve nature and empowers producers and farm workers.
In practice, we encourage and support our ingredient suppliers to drive continuous improvement in sustainable farming practices, based on our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA).

3 Source: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations: Water for Sustainable Food and Agriculture, a report produced for the G20 Presidency of Germany In 2022, 64% of our global priority ingredient volumes were sustainably sourced to our Leader standard, in line with our PSA.
We currently only report our Leader-level volumes publicly.
We do not currently report Mover or Thriving farmers and farming important for our supply chain.
Our ability to deliver quality products depends on having a sustainable and secure supply of Our complex supply chain spans the globe and includes many kinds of suppliers, from multinational companies to smallholder farmers.
The PSA, introduced in 2021 to replace our Sustainable Agriculture Guiding Principles (SAGP), take a long-term perspective and reflect the most recent science, our total beverage portfolio, and our increasingly diverse supply chain.
The PSA are designed to encourage continuous improvement in farming practices and lead to more ethical and The PSA framework for evaluating the compliance and performance of our supply farm base recognizes the on-the-ground realities in sustainable farming practices across a diversity of supply chains, farm structures and risk contexts.
Based on the PSA framework, suppliers are designated as either a Leader, Mover or Improver.
We are currently analyzing against the PSA framework the volume of the 12 global priority ingredients we procure.
This mapping, which we aim to complete by the end of 2025, will help determine how we engage with suppliers to • All of our agricultural-based suppliers will demonstrate continuous improvement and will be categorized by The Coca-Cola Company as either a Leader, Mover or Improver.
• All of our global priority ingredient suppliers and their farm supply base will work toward achieving “Leader” status over time.
Supply volume is verified to company approved standards, with third- party assurance aligned with the PSA.1 • ��MOVER: Supply volume is sourced from farms using other agricultural farming standards, effectively identifying and addressing key sustainability issues and • ��IMPROVER: Supply volume is sourced participating in a support program to continuously improve their priority Irrigated agriculture remains the largest user of water globally, accounting for 70% of water use worldwide,3 and has significant impacts on watershed health.
Agriculture is also one of the sectors most impacted by water stress and drought.
Water use within our agriculture supply chain accounts for the vast majority of the surface water and groundwater consumed in the production of our beverages.
Therefore, we are working with our suppliers to help promote the long-term sustainability of water resources through the implementation of advanced water management practices at the farm level.
In addition, we are including our priority sourcing regions as part of our water replenishment programs.
For example, in 2022, in partnership with Doktar, an agri-tech company, and with funding from The Coca-Cola Foundation, we launched a project in the regions of Bursa and Tekirdağ in Türkiye, which are priority sourcing regions for apples.
The project aims to improve irrigation efficiency and agricultural practices on approximately 500 acres of land growing apples, peaches, nectarines and tomatoes, which are major water users.
Sensors will be installed to monitor climate and soil moisture conditions and satellite data (Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope) will be used to calculate levels of evapotranspiration.
All of this data will be combined to provide personalized irrigation programs for participating farmers and help to avoid excessive watering.
Drip irrigation infrastructure will be built on selected sites, which helps to reduce water use, and artificial reservoirs will be constructed to capture and hold rainwater to be used for It is estimated that drip irrigation will lead to a 20% increase in water efficiency for apple, peach and nectarine production and a 50% increase for 2022 Progress on Sustainable Sourcing2 tomato growing as farmers shift from a flood- based irrigation system.
We estimate the project will replenish approximately 500 million liters of water per year.
The improvements in water-use efficiency are expected to help reduce costs and increase profitability for the farmers.
Over the past year, we have worked closely with our suppliers to map our sourcing regions for our global priority ingredients.
While we recognize that traceability is not always perfect, and our supplier base is dynamic, we have begun to understand sourcing regions for our global priority ingredients that are exposed to high or extremely high water stress.
We are focusing on engagement with suppliers in these priority In 2022 and early 2023, we approached more than 45 suppliers that source ingredients from regions facing high or extremely high water stress, to gather data on their water management practices.
In 2023, we plan to analyze this information to develop a baseline that will feed a supplier engagement strategy and This partnership has guided us with a focus on the right solutions for young farmers in highly water-stressed regions of Türkiye.”
THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT For details on how we address human rights risks in our agricultural supply chain, see the For details on how we address deforestation risks in our agricultural supply chain, see our Smallholder farmers play an essential role in our supply chain.
Their livelihoods can be particularly vulnerable because they lack the resources and scale of commercial farmers.
We partner with a range of nonprofits, communities, industry organizations and other companies to support smallholder farmers in becoming more efficient and productive while improving water and climate footprints, managing soil health, maintaining crop protection, and respecting the human rights of their workforce and labor contractors.
The “Improver” category of our PSA segmentation includes smallholders who may never be able to gain formal certification but who can, with appropriate support, contribute to more sustainable and regenerative agriculture while increasing their own incomes and resilience.
Agriculture in Egypt faces many challenges, including water scarcity, water pollution, desertification and land degradation.
Through a grant from The Coca-Cola Foundation to Global Water Challenge (GWC), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Egypt Network for Sustainable Development (ENID) implemented a project in the Qena governorate in Upper Egypt to demonstrate the value of using a greenhouse cultivation model to produce vegetables (e.g., eggplants and tomatoes), and the recycling and use of crop residues (materials left over after a crop harvest, e.g., stalks and stems) as compost on local farms.
Local farmers and laborers received equipment and training in these improved farming techniques.
The application of compost increased the soil moisture holding capacity on farmland and reduced the need for synthetic fertilizer.
It is estimated that composting reduced the use of water for irrigation by as much as 23%.
This decreased farming costs and generated an additional revenue stream for farmers.
The recycling of crop residues provided income and short-term job opportunities for local residents along with longer-term employment prospects for approximately 500 individuals, including almost 100 women, who received training in the production and application of compost.
The project also reduced the need for burning, which is the traditional way of disposing of agricultural waste.
Regenerative agriculture is often referred to as a system of farming that focuses on positive outcomes that ensure the long-term viability of land to sustain production by working “with nature” rather than against it.
A number of our completed and ongoing projects promote sustainable agriculture practices (e.g., use of cover crops) and contribute to positive outcomes, including reduced soil erosion and the buildup of organic matter.
We will use key learnings from these projects to inform the design of future projects and incorporate regenerative agriculture As a founding member of the SAI Platform’s Regenerative Agriculture Framework, we are supporting the development of an industry solution for measuring outcomes of regenerative agriculture practices at the farm level.
We are also actively involved with SAI Platform’s work on the Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA), a global verification framework and benchmark reference designed to accelerate sustainable agriculture.
The latest version, FSA 3.0, includes a self-assessment questionnaire and a continuous improvement module that offers guidance for developing, implementing and monitoring We are working with partners to support smallholder farmers in Brazil’s citrus sector, which is the largest in the world.
Many smallholder farmers in Brazil have struggled, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
As part of an industry initiative named Fruto Resiliente, which began in 2019, we are partnering with Eckes-Granini, Cutrale, one of our citrus juice suppliers, Solidaridad and innocent drinks, with co-funding from The Coca-Cola Foundation, to support nearly 500 smallholder farmers.
The project aims to improve sustainable agriculture practices in the production of oranges by providing training to smallholders, including female farmers, in topics such as water, soil management and labor standards.
Technical materials and resources (including booklets, podcasts, and videos) are shared for free online, and smallholders benefit from field visits to a demonstration farm operated by Sylvio Moreira Citrus Research Center (CCSM) of the Agronomic Institute (IAC).
With project support, this state experimental farm reached the FSA/SAI gold level1.
In 2022, the project directly assisted approximately 200 orange farms.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY 2022 BUSINESS & SUSTAINABILITY REPORT DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION GIVING BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES EMBEDDING HUMAN RIGHTS ACROSS OUR NETWORK Our industry-leading global audit program is a key component of our long-term, ongoing commitment to supporting human rights.
We use the same rigorous SGP protocols to audit our own operations as we do our bottling partners and Tier 1 suppliers (packaging and ingredients).
In 2022, we conducted 2,770 audits and found that 99% of our own operations, 93% of system bottlers and 91% of our Tier 1 suppliers complied with our SGP protocols.
These audit results are reviewed by the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee of our Board of Directors on an annual basis.
While this process helps us hold our company and partners accountable, we also focus on building capacity to support respect for human rights across our value chain.
This includes providing training and resources such as checklists, toolkits and guidelines.
In 2022, we conducted bottler and supplier human rights-focused training across seven of our operating units, attended by COLLABORATING TO COMBAT FORCED LABOR Forced labor is a human rights issue that plagues global supply chains and is a risk in virtually every company’s value chain.
No company can solve this systemic failure alone—collaboration is the cornerstone of progress.
We have joined with other companies as part of The Consumer Goods Forum to support its Human Rights Coalition (HRC).
Serving as Co-Chair of the HRC, The Coca-Cola Company has helped HRC drive action to: • Help make Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) the norm in our industry by implementing forced • Implement HRDD systems in certain targeted high-risk supply chains, starting with palm oil in the People Positive Palm Project; and • Support the development of responsible recruitment markets through capacity building We also collaborate with leading responsible businesses as part of the Leadership Group for Responsible Recruitment.

SPORTS & HUMAN RIGHTS The Coca-Cola Company is a long-time sponsor of global sporting events, including the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup.
As a sponsor, the company has worked consistently with sport governing bodies, NGOs, governments, and unions to embed respect for human rights into the life cycle of these events.
This work includes our leadership in the Centre for Sport & Human Rights, an organization that promotes human rights in the world of sport.
We have seen progress in this space, including the International Olympic Committee issuing its first Strategic Framework on Human Rights, and FIFA adopting its own human rights policy and establishing a dedicated human rights program.
Leading up to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, the company and other sponsors engaged with FIFA, the Government of Qatar, and NGOs to help improve labor rights in the country, with important developments including Qatar’s enactment of significant labor reforms and FIFA’s announcement of a Legacy Fund to establish a labor excellence hub in partnership with the INFORMAL WASTE COLLECTION WORKERS
The Coca-Cola Company has been a leader in driving ambitious sustainable packaging through our World Without Waste program.
We have collaborated with peers across our industry, government, and civil society to tackle the issue Informal waste workers—or grassroots recyclers— collect and sort up to 60% of plastic waste that is recycled around the world.1 They are integral to the functioning of an efficient, circular economy for packaging.
They are also extremely vulnerable to human rights abuse.
The severity and complexity of human rights impacts on grassroots recyclers makes multi-stakeholder collaboration essential.
In 2022, we partnered with other leading consumer goods companies and NGOs to launch the Fair Circularity Principles, which apply the expectations and responsibilities in the UN Guiding Principles to grassroots recycling.

In October, The Coca-Cola Company was delighted to host the 14th Annual Engaging Business Forum at our headquarters in Atlanta.
Sponsored by the International Organization of Employers, the United States Council for International Business and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Forum has become one of the preeminent business and human rights conferences, where business leaders and experts from civil society, trade unions and governments hold candid discussions on business experience in respecting human rights across their operations and supply chains.
The theme of this latest Forum was The Future of Responsible Business Conduct, with stakeholder panels discussing subjects such as the increasing regulation of human rights, grievance mechanisms and effective remedy collaborations, and the growth of investor benchmarks.
Our company has been working with Bonsucro, a leading international NGO, as well as other local and international experts to address human rights risks in the sugarcane supply chain in Pakistan.
Our partners include GoodWeave International, a non-profit with expertise in stopping child, forced and bonded labor in global supply chains, and AgNovate, a respected local organization and licensed Bonsucro trainer.
This two-and-a-half-year project, which runs to the end of 2024, aims to improve the adoption of sustainable and responsible labor practices in sugar production and develop remediation plans to address child labor and forced labor prevalent in the industry.
In November 2022, AgNovate delivered the first training session of the project to 31 participants, including managers of sugar mills.
The training was based on GoodWeave’s best practices on ending child and worker exploitation.
Gap assessments were then conducted of the six partner sugar mills and selected smallholder farmers on their compliance with the requirements of the Bonsucro Production Standard, which includes ensuring workers do not suffer from forced labor and there is no child labor.
The project will support the mills to develop their own action plans toward continuous improvement and compliance with version 5.1 of the Bonsucro Production Standard.
The Coca-Cola Company has developed a digital platform that identifies recruitment-related human rights risks within supply chains together with our partners Diginex, an impact technology company, and Reckitt, another consumer goods company.
The platform aims to improve respect for human rights in the hiring process through due diligence and The platform evolved to include a multilingual worker- voice tool, diginexAPPRISE, which allows companies to conduct digital worker interviews in supply chains at scale, increasing transparency and preventing unethical recruitment practices.
The use of smartphone technology allows a greater number of workers to be reached and helps ensure that foreign migrant workers with low literacy levels are included in the interview process.
We were pleased to convene the Fair Circularity Initiative, which was launched by The Coca-Cola Company and three of their peers in late 2022.
When companies adopt and advance the new Fair Circularity Principles in their value chains, engaging meaningfully with waste pickers, it will lead to human rights being respected, including better incomes and working conditions, and inclusion in decision-making processes that affect their lives.”

The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP” or referred to herein as “reported”).
However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends.
Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating the company’s performance.
Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting.

This is the focused scope of Primary Consumer Packaging (PET, Glass, Cans, Cartons).
This number has been updated following the completed assurance process for the 2020 World Without Waste Report, which was completed post-publication of the 2020 Business & ESG Report.
3 Includes select Primary Consumer Packaging materials.
In 2019, we modified the methodology we use for calculating the amount of recycled material used in our Primary Consumer Packaging.
These changes are designed to integrate a more accurate dataset, including primary data where it is available.
Moving forward, we expect that these numbers will continue to evolve as data sources improve, at the same time that we work to increase rates of recycled material use.
5 We changed our method to track the packaging collection rate against our World Without Waste goal beginning with 2018 data.
With better data available, we expanded the metric to encompass all of our packaging types, including beverage cartons, juice boxes and pouches, etc. 6 Collection rate represents a weighted average of national collection rates, collected for recycling rates or refillable rates by packaging type to TCCS’s sales in units to express the percent of equivalent bottles and cans introduced into the market that were collected and refilled or collected for recycling for the year.
Collection rates are determined by country for each packaging type based on either national studies (approximately 82%), plant standards (approximately 17%), and internal estimates (approximately 1%).

Includes reports and allegations raised through The Coca-Cola Company’s Human Rights Policy reporting process.
In 2019, Employee Relations redefined how cases were captured in the case management tool of record.
Therefore, the reported figure includes only those allegations that required investigations only as opposed to generalized questions raised to Employee Relations.
Please note, however, that all questions presented to Employee Relations were answered even if the question did not warrant an investigation.
While we previously reported on all cases and questions raised through our case management tool, we no longer capture that data.
